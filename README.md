The code "protest_phase_1.m" is an example for solving the non-spatial model (i.e., ODE-driven model) and for illustrating the corresponding phase portrait.
The code "pattern_1d_gh.m" is an example for solving the spatial model (i.e., PDE-driven model) with one-dimensional space and for illustrating the corresponding 1D pattern.
The code "pattern_2d_gh.m" is an example for solving the spatial model (i.e., PDE-driven model) with two-dimensional space and for illustrating the corresponding 2D pattern.
